    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This story is about a man who, two years ago, tried to move on after breaking up with his lover. He and his partner had spent countless hours together at this cafÃ©, building memories in every corner. After the breakup, the man stopped visiting, convincing himself he had fully moved on and left the past behind.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But today, after two long years, his feet led him back to the same cafÃ©. He came believing that he wouldn't feel anything anymore, that the old memories wouldn't haunt him. But the moment he walked in and sat at his usual corner, every little detailâ€”the walls of the cafÃ©, the waiterâ€™s smile, the aroma of coffeeâ€”began to awaken something inside him.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The cafÃ© was a living gallery of his past, filled with pictures of conversations, laughter, and fleeting moments they once shared. It felt as though every moment from the past had come alive again through his senses. He thought he had left all that behind, but the familiarity of the place, the memories, the old habitsâ€”they all reminded him of the love he thought he had forgotten. It was as though he were still deeply entangled in that past, even now.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As he sat there, his eyes fell on a newspaper that had been left on the table. The front page carried a story about a young man who had died in a motorcycle accident, and beside it was a tragic report about a loverâ€™s suicide. For a brief moment, the man saw the newspaper as if it were a ledger of a "Grim Reaper", a record of lives that were lost or given away in a fleeting instant. The hot samosas wrapped in the paper were delicious, but their crisp layers seemed to shout out the bitterness that he had been carrying inside him.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He reached into his bag, pulled out a pen, and began to write on a piece of paper. His thoughts flowed onto it like an old melody that had never truly left him. He wrote:</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Two years have passed away,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Iâ€™m sitting at this cafÃ© again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But your memory doesnâ€™t </span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">seem to haunt me,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Iâ€™ve forgotten you so easily!"</span></em></strong></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He paused, looking at the cup that the waiter had just placed in front of him. The waiter had brought a cappuccino, without asking, just like always. It was the same coffeeâ€”black, no sugarâ€”that he never liked, but someone really did.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Tell me, do you still </span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">drink coffee without sugar?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Or have you started to </span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">like it sweet, after me?"</span></em></strong></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He smiled a little at the thought, remembering how his back-then sweetheart used to argue that sugar ruined the true taste of coffee. Then his mind wandered to the cafÃ© manager, the man who always used to contempt the idea of love. "Heâ€™s married now, and happy," he mused. "Perhaps youâ€™re happy too, wherever you are."</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">His thoughts were interrupted by the sight of a man sitting two tables away. The man was carefully scraping the cream off his coffee. For some reason, that small act made him think of a particular eveningâ€”a blued evening, just like the deep, dark coffee in his cup. It was a memory of a time when he had been with his ex, and they had shared moments just like this, even down to the way they had both scraped the cream from their coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He looked at the man again, noticing the way he avoided adding milk or sugar, just like he had. Was the man lonely too, like he had been? His thoughts were interrupted when the cafÃ©â€™s radio suddenly played a familiar song. It was the same tune his ex used to hum all the time, a tune that was now just a part of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He didnâ€™t ask the waiter to turn the music off. Instead, he let it play, remembering how it used to sound when his lover sang along. Then, as if on cue, the man at the neighbouring table, who must have recognized the song as well, switched off the radio. It was as if they were all connected by the same, silent thread of memory.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He took another sip of his coffee. It was bitter, just like the past he couldnâ€™t entirely shake off. The words in the book he had tried to read now seemed meaningless. He added sugar to the coffee, but it didnâ€™t help much. It was still bitter.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Maybe Iâ€™ve become the 'Muntazir' who waits," he wrote, "watching life pass by, while others move on more easily than I ever could."</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He paused, staring at the cup in his hands. The coffee was growing cold, and the cream had settled into it, making it thick and heavy.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">His hand reached out, and he drank the entire cup in one go, without grimacing, without flinching. For the first time, he drank it allâ€”just as it was, bitter and unsweetened. And as the last drop went down, he smiled faintly. Perhaps he had finally let go.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He stood up, left the cafÃ©, and walked away, leaving behind the tip he had forgotten. It didnâ€™t matter anymore.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After all, the coffee had been bitter. And so, perhaps, had the memories.</span></p>
    <p class="ms-5 ps-5 me-5 pe-5"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But in that bitterness, there was also a strange kind of peace.</span></p>
